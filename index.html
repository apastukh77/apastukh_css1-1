            <p>Before the war, endless reforms were carried out in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, most often the reforms
                were
                with optimization of the number of military units and subunits. 2013 was marked by numerical reductions
                for the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
                As a result of the next criminal reform in 2013 by the decree of the President of Ukraine instead of 3
                bodies of territorial management
                of Land forces 2, on the basis of 6 AK and 13 AK were created:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Operational Command “South” (Dnipropetrovsk)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Operational Command “North” (Rivne)
                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>The commander of the 6th Army Corps general Ruslan Khomchak became the commander of the operational
                command "South".
                Under the command of the Operational Command "South" were military units and subunits of the Land
                Forces, as well
                as local military authorities, which were territorially located in 13 regions of Ukraine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Operational Command "South" lasted until 2015.
